Zillow is an American tech real-estate marketplace company. In their website www.zillow.com it lists information of different types of real-estate properties such as houses, apartments, villas, to rent and to buy. In addition, Zillow also has their own tool 'Zestimate' to estimate the value of real-estate properties. 



## What data is scraped? 

- Prices of real-estate properties in USA
- Size of the properties: quantity of bedrooms, bathrooms and total area. 
- Addresses of the properties 
- Links of the properties
- Additional information is added by using two free APIs:
  - [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) for Schools per city per state
